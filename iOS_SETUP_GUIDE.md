# iOS App (IPA) Setup Guide

If you want to create an iOS version of your Medexer app, here are your options:

## Option 1: React Native (Recommended)

### 1.1 Create React Native Project

```bash
# Install React Native CLI
npm install -g @react-native-community/cli

# Create new project
npx react-native init MedexerMobile --template react-native-template-typescript

# Navigate to project
cd MedexerMobile
```

### 1.2 Share Code with Desktop App

```bash
# Create shared package
mkdir packages
mkdir packages/shared

# Move shared components/logic to packages/shared
# Use tools like:
# - Metro (React Native bundler)
# - React Native Web (for web compatibility)
# - Shared TypeScript types
```

### 1.3 Configure iOS Build

```bash
# Install iOS dependencies
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# Build for iOS
npx react-native run-ios

# Build IPA for distribution
npx react-native build-ios --mode Release
```

## Option 2: Capacitor (Hybrid App)

### 2.1 Add Capacitor to Existing Project

```bash
# Install Capacitor
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
npm install @capacitor/ios

# Initialize Capacitor
npx cap init Medexer com.medexer.mobile

# Add iOS platform
npx cap add ios
```

### 2.2 Build and Deploy

```bash
# Build web assets
npm run build

# Sync to iOS
npx cap sync ios

# Open in Xcode
npx cap open ios

# Build IPA in Xcode
```

## Option 3: Native iOS (Swift/Objective-C)

### 3.1 Create Xcode Project

1. Open Xcode
2. Create new iOS project
3. Choose "App" template
4. Set bundle identifier: `com.medexer.mobile`

### 3.2 Build IPA

1. Select "Any iOS Device" as target
2. Product → Archive
3. Distribute App → App Store Connect
4. Follow upload wizard

## Current Desktop App vs iOS App

| Feature          | Desktop (Electron)  | iOS (React Native/Capacitor) |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Platform**     | macOS               | iOS                          |
| **Distribution** | DMG/ZIP             | IPA                          |
| **App Store**    | Mac App Store       | iOS App Store                |
| **Code Signing** | Developer ID        | iOS Distribution             |
| **Bundle ID**    | com.medexer.desktop | com.medexer.mobile           |

## Recommendation

For your medical center app, I recommend:

1. **Keep your Electron desktop app** for medical staff workstations
2. **Create a React Native mobile app** for:
   - Patient check-ins
   - Mobile access for doctors
   - Push notifications
   - Offline capabilities

This gives you the best of both worlds:

- Full-featured desktop app for complex workflows
- Mobile app for convenience and mobility

## Next Steps

1. **Decide on approach** (React Native recommended)
2. **Create new mobile project**
3. **Share business logic** between desktop and mobile
4. **Configure iOS build** and code signing
5. **Build IPA** for App Store submission
